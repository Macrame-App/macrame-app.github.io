## Word from the creator:

I didn't even know I would take this project this far, but I'd thought other people could use the functionality of Macrame just like me. 
This is my first open-source project, so if anything looks wonky it's probably because of my inexperience. 

The reason I started this project is because I wasn't satisfied with the options for macro button panels. 
Since I already built something similar a few years back I thought I'd improve on the previous application. 

So now couple months have passed and I've come farther than I thought and actually have a working application. 
At the time of writing this, the application is in a very early stage and only contains the functionality I absolutely wanted. 
If the application turns out to be popular and useful to people, I am planning to implement new features and QOL updates. 

My intention is for Macrame to remain a free and open-source application that can be used by whoever wants to. 

Thanks a lot for trying the application if you did, and any feedback is greatly appreciated!
