<span class="line"><span>                       Version 3, 29 June 2007</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>                            Preamble</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>software and other kinds of works.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>your programs, too.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>know their rights.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&#39; and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>authors of previous versions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software.  The systematic</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>modification follow.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  0. Definitions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>works, such as semiconductor masks.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>on the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>public, and in some countries other activities as well.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  1. Source Code.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>form of a work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>is widely used among developers working in that language.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>includes interface definition files associated with source files for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>subprograms and other parts of the work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Source.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>same work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  2. Basic Permissions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>makes it unnecessary.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>measures.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>technological measures.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    modified it, and giving a relevant date.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    released under this License and any conditions added under </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    section</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    to &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    License gives no permission to license the work in any other </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    separately received it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>parts of the aggregate.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in one of these ways:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    product (including a physical distribution medium), </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    physical medium customarily used for software interchange.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    product (including a physical distribution medium), </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    customer support for that product model, to give anyone </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Corresponding Source for all the software in the product </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    price no more than your reasonable cost of physically </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    no charge.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    This alternative is allowed only occasionally and </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    noncommercially, and only if you received the object code </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    way through the same place at no further charge.  You need </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    along with the object code.  If the place to copy the </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    provided you maintain clear directions next to the object </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    provided you inform other peers where the object code and </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    general public at no charge under subsection 6d.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>included in conveying the object code work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the only significant mode of use of the product.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>modification has been made.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>been installed in ROM).</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>protocols for communication across the network.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>source code form), and must require no special password or key for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>unpacking, reading or copying.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  7. Additional Terms.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>this License without regard to the additional permissions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    notices or author attributions in that material or in the </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    material, or requiring that modified versions of such material </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    version; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    licensors or authors of the material; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    the recipient, for any liability that these contractual </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>governed by this License along with a term that is a further</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>not survive such relicensing or conveying.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>where to find the applicable terms.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the above requirements apply either way.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  8. Termination.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>paragraph of section 11).</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>prior to 60 days after the cessation.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>your receipt of the notice.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>material under section 10.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  11. Patents.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>propagate the contents of its contributor version.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>patent against the party.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>country that you have reason to believe are valid.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>work and works based on it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>combination as such.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  14. Revised Versions of this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>address new problems or concerns.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>version or of any later version published by the Free Software</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>by the Free Software Foundation.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to choose that version for the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  Later license versions may give you additional or different</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>later version.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  16. Limitation of Liability.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>SUCH DAMAGES.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>copy of the Program in return for a fee.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div></main><footer class="VPDocFooter" data-v-39a288b8 data-v-e257564d><!--[--><!--]--><!----><nav class="prev-next" aria-labelledby="doc-footer-aria-label" data-v-e257564d><span class="visually-hidden" id="doc-footer-aria-label" data-v-e257564d>Pager</span><div class="pager" data-v-e257564d><a class="VPLink link pager-link prev" href="/about/creator.html" data-v-e257564d><!--[--><span class="desc" data-v-e257564d>Previous page</span><span class="title" data-v-e257564d>Creator</span><!--]--></a></div><div class="pager" data-v-e257564d><!----></div></nav></footer><!--[--><!--]--></div></div></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><footer class="VPFooter has-sidebar" data-v-5d98c3a5 data-v-e315a0ad><div class="container" data-v-e315a0ad><p class="message" data-v-e315a0ad>Licensed under the GNU GPLv3 <a href='license'>license</a></p><p class="copyright" data-v-e315a0ad>Copyright © 2025-present <a href='https://github.com/JaxxMoss'>Jesse Malotaux</a></p></div></footer><!--[--><!--]--></div></div>
