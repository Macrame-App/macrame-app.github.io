### What can I use Macrame for?

You can use Macrame to record keyboard macros and those macros can be played through a button panel. 

This way you can turn any old tablet or your phone into a button panel for your PC!

### Is Macrame safe to use?

Generally, yes. If used on a secured LAN network. 

The application doesn't alter anything outside of the directory it is placed in, other than an exception in the firewall. 

::: warning
  ##### Don't use this application on an unsecured or public network!

  **If used on an unsecured or public network your PC will be vunerable.** 

  Macrame does use authorization, but this is an application in development and it has not been properly tested.

::: details Why does Windows warn me the application is unsafe?
  This is because Macrame hasn't been certified yet. The certification costs money, money I am not willing to invest just yet. 
  If more people will use the application I will consider certifying the applicaiton. 

  If you understand the risks, you can still run the application even though Windows warns you it's unsafe.

### Will Macrame become available on Linux and Mac?

Yes, but because I have developed this application on Windows and tend to use it on the same machine. The first versions will be Windows only. 

In later stages the application will be compiled for Linux and Mac.

### Will there be a dedicated Macrame app?

Yes. It will probably not be available in the official stores, but for Android an APK will be made available. 

For now you can use a standard browser. For a better experience you can use a browser application that can be used in fullscreen.

### Do I need a good specs to use Macrame?

No. Older devices might struggle a bit with the animations, but you will still be able to use the app. 

I haven't tested Macrame on older computers, but I don't think it will struggle with performance.

### What is used to build Macrame?

The base of the application that interacts with your system is build with [Go](https://go.dev/). The webapplication is build with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). 

Panels can be created with standard HTML, CSS and JS. More information about the creation of panels on [this page](/docs/panels/creation).

### Word from the creator:

My intention is for Macrame to remain a free and open-source application that can be used by whoever wants to. 
I started building this application because I had used a similar application that didn't meet my expectations. 
Since I had some experience with building an application like this I decided to just start building Macrame. 

I wanted macros to be easily shareable and panels to be "easily" created (by someone with knowledge of HTML). 

I have succeeded thusfar and if a lot of people start using this application I plan to add more features and better usability. 

Thanks a lot for trying the application if you did, and any feedback is greatly appreciated!
