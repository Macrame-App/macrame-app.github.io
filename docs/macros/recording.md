# Recording macros

#### To record a macro first you need to open the macros page on the server.

---

1. To start a new macro enter a name in the input field.

2. After the name has been entered, you can press the **Record** button.

3. Press the desired keyboard combination and press the **Stop** button when you're done.

   ::: info
   Some key combinations are impossible to record as a whole.

   For example: "CTRL + T" will still open a new browser tab and "break" the recording of the macro.

   _A tutorial on how to ommit this bug will be added later.
   And the bug will hopefully be fully fixed in future versions of the application!_

5. Press the **Save** button to save the macro to a JSON file.

   This will reload the page and show the newly created macro in the overview on the left side of the page.
