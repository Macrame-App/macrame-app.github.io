# Panel Usage

#### Macrame button panels can be used to play macros. Panels are simple HTML pages that can be styled with CSS. 

## Key features
- Panels are stored as an HTML file in subdirectories of the panels directory. View the [panel creation](/panels/creation) documenation on how to create a panel.
- Panels can be shared by sharing the panels subdirectory. 
- Macros can only be used by remote devices if they are linked in a panel.
- Macros can be linked through the panels page on the server. View the [linking macros](/panels/linking-macros) documentation on how to link macros.
