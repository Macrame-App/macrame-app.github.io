# Editing Macros

#### Macros can be edited in the app. Or if you're feeling adventurous you can edit the JSON files directly.

_To start editing a macro you first have to [record a macro](/macros/recording) or open a saved macro_

&nbsp;

1. Click the **Edit** button in the macro recorder view.

   _The macro recorder will turn blue and you will be able to click on the individual keys and delays_

&nbsp;

2. To add a fixed delay between all the button presses you can click the **Fixed delay** button.

   A small menu will open and you will be presented by a couple of options.

   _You will still be able to edit the individual delays, if you want_

&nbsp;

3. To delete a key, click the desired key to select it, and press the **Delete** button. Located at the top right of the recorder.

&nbsp;

4. To edit a key or delay and click **edit**. Located at the top right of the recorder.

   A dialog will open to edit the button or the delay.

&nbsp;

5. To insert a key before or after another key, click the key where you want to insert the key and click **Insert**. A small menu will show and you can select **Before** or **After**.
